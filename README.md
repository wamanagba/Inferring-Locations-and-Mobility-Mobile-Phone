# Inferring Locations and Mobility from Mobile Phone Data







This script explores how patterns of residence and mobility can be inferred from synthetic Call Detail Records (CDRs) across Togo.

Over a 91-day observation period (January–March 2020), I combined spatial mapping, algorithmic residence detection, and uncertainty analysis to extract behavioral insights from anonymized mobile data.



The Most Unique Days - Nighttime approach emerged as the most effective method for identifying home prefectures.

By focusing on distinct nighttime activity, it captures where people truly reside rather than where they work or travel.

The algorithm inferred home locations for about 97% of subscribers, with 89% weekly coverage, demonstrating strong consistency even within a synthetic dataset.
